game discription->
Simon Says presents you with four blocks of different colors in the center of the screen. One of these blocks will randomly flash, and your objective is to remember the flashing block and click on it.

As you progress through the levels, the game becomes more challenging. You must recall not only the current flashing block but also the sequence of previously flashed blocks from earlier levels.
